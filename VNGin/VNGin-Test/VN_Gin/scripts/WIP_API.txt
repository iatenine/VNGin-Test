Story.gd
Manages data for a single story including options, dialogues and chapter meta data

Stories are effectively 2D arrays with each chapter occupying 1 column
Item 0 in each chapter is a specialized page containing its name, number and path
Linear stories should all use path 0 and branching stories will use this as the default

Pages beyond 0 have the following features:
Speaker: What you would like to appear in the name box
Speech: The main text for a player to read, typically dialogue
options: A dictionary of relevant options to this page (explained below)
choices: A dictionary of dictionaries for branching storylines (explained below)

Options:
Use the following by passing a filepath
   image: The image to be displayed front and center, usually a character who is speaking
   music: Music to begin playing at this point (looping)
   sfx: A sound to play at this point (non-looping)
   background: A background to be loaded at this moment in the story
Use the following by passing an int
    pauseTime: Add a dramatic pause before showing the next button
    decisionTime: Add a countdown for the player to make a decision
                  (the current path will be treated as default if time runs out)
